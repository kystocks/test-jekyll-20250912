# Learning Jekyll for SI 676

This post documents my experience setting up Jekyll as part of Lab 3 for SI 676 - DNS and Web Infrastructure.

## What I've Accomplished

Setting up a Jekyll static site has been an interesting learning experience. Here's what I've done so far:

- **Ruby Environment Setup**: Updated from Ruby 2.6.10 to Ruby 3.4.5 using Homebrew
- **Jekyll Installation**: Successfully installed Jekyll 4.4.1 and Bundler 2.7.2
- **Site Creation**: Created this Jekyll site and got it running locally
- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Published the site to GitHub Pages with proper configuration

## Technical Challenges

The most challenging part was configuring the `baseurl` and `url` settings correctly for GitHub Pages deployment. Getting the paths right took some troubleshooting, but now the site displays properly with full styling at `https://kystocks.github.io/test-jekyll-20250912/`.

## Next Steps

As I continue working with Jekyll for this course, I plan to:
- Learn more about Jekyll's templating system
- Explore different themes and customization options
- Use Jekyll for future SI 676 assignments and projects

## Course Context

This site serves as my hands-on introduction to static site generators and web infrastructure concepts that we're covering in SI 676. It's fascinating to see how Jekyll transforms markdown files into a complete website structure.
